This repository stores scripts that I have written for my job as a Data Specialist at UVA's Institutional Research and Analytics (IRA) department. UVA IRA handles data requests from staff/students, provides university leadership with data insights, and generates data for external reporting requirements (such as college board, common dataset, IPEDS, and SCHEV). The scripts are mostly data processing/data engineering focused for answering various questions or generating data for reports. Mostly, I generate data in Qlik (powerBI alternative) and use Python or Excel to process the data.
